# Online-Grocery-Store

The following assumptions were made:

If there was ever an amount given which was unable to be achieved exactly by the pre packed products, it was assumed that the required amount was the smallest achievable value which was at least the given amount. For example, if the user asked for 7 toilet rolls, that amount cannot be reached with packs of 3 and 5. So instead the order is created for 8 packs of toilet rolls. 

It is also assumed that an order of 18 yoghurts will calculate an output of 18 yoghurts. Not 28 yoghurts.
